Finance Dashboard API - Backend Assignment
A robust, logically structured, and scalable backend application providing RESTful APIs for a finance dashboard system. Built to evaluate API design, data modeling, role-based access control (RBAC), and overall backend engineering skills.

🌟 Core Features Implemented (100% Assignment Fulfillment)
1. User Management & Authentication
Secure Authentication: Uses jsonwebtoken (JWT) for secure authentication flows.
Password Security: Uses bcrypt for strong password hashing before saving to the DB.
Roles & Permissions Policies: Strict guards isolating routes by VIEWER, ANALYST, and ADMIN.
User Actions: Endpoints to create, update (promote/demote roles, activate/deactivate status), fetch, and gracefully delete users.
2. Financial Records Management
Full CRUD Flows: Admins can safely manage (Create, Read, Update, Delete) financial transactions.
Advanced Filtering: Endpoints handle flexible query parameters allowing filtering by Date Ranges (startDate/endDate), category, and type (INCOME/EXPENSE).
3. Aggregated Dashboard Summaries
Computes comprehensive high-level analytics efficiently on the database level:
Overall Summary: Total Income, Total Expenses, Net Balance, and top 5 recent activities.
Category Breakdown: Aggregates records categorized by their sources.
Monthly Trends: Aggregates grouped by YYYY-MM to allow plotting historical trend charts.
4. Validation, Resiliency & Clean Code
Runtime Validation: Integrates zod object schemas to rigorously check the payloads (preventing negative amounts, missing fields, or invalid types).
Global Error Handling: Custom catch-all error handling to prevent the server from crashing or exposing stack traces.
🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack
This project was intentionally kept lightweight yet maintainable.

Language: TypeScript (node.js + tsx)
Framework: Express.js
Database: SQLite3 (Simplifies assessment by requiring zero external DBMS configuration/Docker). Includes auto-configuration and table initialization.
Security Check: Role-based routing middlewares.
🚀 Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Setup Environment Variables
Since the .env file contains sensitive information, it is not committed to GitHub. You need to create this file manually before running the app.

Create a file named .env in the root directory.
Add the following variables to it:
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
3. Install Dependencies
npm install zod sqlite3 bcrypt express jsonwebtoken uuid cors express-async-errors dotenv
npm install -D tsx typescript @types/node @types/express @types/bcrypt @types/jsonwebtoken @types/uuid @types/cors
4. Run the Application
Start the backend server:

npx tsx src/server.ts
Note: A default Admin user is automatically seeded upon starting the app for the very first time.

Email: admin@finance.com
Password: admin123
🧪 Testing the APIs (The Easy Way)
To make grading and checking the API as frictionless as possible, an api-test.http file is included natively in the repository. You don't need Postman!

Open VS Code extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) and install REST Client (by Huachao Mao).
Start the Node.js server.
Open api-test.http.
Click "Send Request" immediately above the POST {{baseUrl}}/users/login endpoint.
In the response window, highlight and copy the generated token property.
Replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE (at the top of api-test.http) with your copied token.
You can now execute and test any other request by clicking the "Send Request" buttons. The RBAC rules and validations will automatically trigger!
🗄️ Database Schema Modeling
users Table: Structurally separated with unique UUIDs, storing email (UNIQUE), password (hashed), role, status, and createdAt timestamps.
records Table: Holds financial logic. Included columns: id, amount (REAL for decimals), type, category, date, notes, and a foreign key userId mapping directly to the users table for referential integrity.
📖 API Documentation & Testing Guide
This section details how to manually test each endpoint using tools like Postman, cURL, or the provided api-test.http file.

Base URL: http://localhost:3000
Authentication: Almost all endpoints require a JWT token. First, hit the Login endpoint, copy the token, and include it in the Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> header for subsequent requests.
